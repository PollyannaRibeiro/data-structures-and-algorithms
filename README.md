# Udacity Nanodegree in Data Structures & Algorithms

Here you can find the projects that I built during the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Structures & Algorithms.
<br>
In this program, I learned the concepts of the main data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, 
queues, recursion, trees, maps, hashing). Building, real-life projects, like for instance, 
LRU cache, Huffman Coding, Blockchain and good application for recursions.
<br>
Also learned the importance of the Big O time and space complexity. And Algorithms like binary search, 
tries, heaps, heapify, sorting (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort) and solved known computer science 
problems projects like dutch national flag problem in a single traversal, autocomplete with tries, HTTP router with trie.
<br>
And got familiar with advanced algorithms concepts, like greedy, Dijkstra’s Algorithms, Graph and A*. 

The language used in this course was python 3.7
