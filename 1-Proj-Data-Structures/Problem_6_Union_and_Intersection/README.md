# Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

The task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. 
The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. 
The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both sets A and B.

Will take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively. 

## Solution

I worked with the set and intersection set method to find the Union and Intersection, 
knowing that a set is based on a hash table, the Big O of getting a set is O(1). However, 
to create and returns the linked list, the time and space complexity are O(n).
