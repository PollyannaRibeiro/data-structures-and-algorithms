# Max and Min in an Unsorted Array
In this problem, we will look for the smallest and largest integers from a list of unsorted integers. 
The code should run in O(n) time. It's not allowed to use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.


## Solution

Searching in a linear way for the smaller and bigger ints of an array of ints. Its time and space complexity is O(n).
