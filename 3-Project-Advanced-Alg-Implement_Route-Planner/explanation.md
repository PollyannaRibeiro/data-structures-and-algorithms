# Implement Route Planner

The `Map` object has two properties: 
* `intersections` 
* `roads`

The `show_map` function takes a few parameters:
* `Graph`- Map to be searched
* `start` - The "start" node for the search algorithm.
* `goal`  - The "goal" node.

## Solution

In this project, I needed to use A* search to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm.
Using an admissible heuristic to direct search efforts towards the goal and data structures which avoid unnecessarily slow lookups.
